                <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
                <p>With VH360°, we're looking to solve the problem of individuals losing touch with their high schools both during attendance and after they graduate. Core memories are formed during these years, and there should be a place to share, view, and reflect on them that's personalized to the specific school. What makes VH360° even more unique compared to popular social media sites is the fact that it's ad-free and isn't focused on content performance. It's simply an archive reserved for students, which must be proven using credentials. This gives it a school-centric, preservationist style.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="section" id="ai">
                <h2>AI Approach</h2>
                <p>We plan to integrate AI into VH360° for content moderation. Our goal is to share appropriate, safe memories, and we intend to use a video analysis tool, like TensorFlow or Hugging Face Transformers. While neither of us have exprience with these tools, we believe this goal is feasible because of the tools' popularity and widespread documentation.</p>

                <h2>Phase 1: Research</h2>
                <p>During this phase, we were mainly focused on deciding exactly what we wanted to create. We knew something with video was interesting to us and we love capturing memories. Therefore, an archive of videos from our high school was the perfect option. From there, we decided something like Vimeo would be better than something like YouTube/Twitch because we wanted it to be more of a file storage website than an algorithm-based feed. Throughout our research, we came to some key conclusions. First, we figured out that we wanted to use H.264 (AVC) for video compression. This can then be paired with Handbrake or FFmpeg for encoding. Additionally, we decided that AWS and their S3 service would be best for hosting our website when we want it to go live. Finally, we came to conclusions on both the front-end and back-end of our website. The front-end will consist of HTML, CSS, and JS. The back-end will be either Django or Flask. We've started a rough draft of our website. It's very similar to YouTube at this time as that is one of our biggest inspirations.</p>

                <h2>Phase 2: Project Development - Early Stages</h2>
                <h3><b>Week 1</b></h3>
                <p><b>Monday</b> - Acquainted ourselves with Figma. Began hypothesizing potential website design elements. No issues faced.<br>
                <b>Tuesday</b> - Identified the original Facebook website as a major design inspiration. Utilized Figma to replicate that inspiration to a moderate extent. Ran into some small problems with how to use different elements of Figma, like overlapping shapes.<br>
                <b>Wednesday</b> - Continued client-facing website development using Figma. Much less issues faced because of newfound experience.<br>
                <b>Thursday</b> - Started to transfer Figma content to physical code for Github using builder.io. Ran into quite a few problems with item sizing on the Github deployment.<br>
                <b>Friday</b> - Used online resources to overcome sizing issues. Successfully created a rough draft of the forward-facing portion of the website. No issues faced.<br><br>
                So far, our most major development is the website's home page. We've created a visually appealing, classic landing screen for future users. Any element that does not yet work, like images or sign-in portions, are placeholders for future implementation. From this point, we'll be able to successfully branch off in future weeks, developing sign-in logic and further polishing the design as well as functionality.
                </p>

                </div>

                <h3><b>Week 2</b></h3>
                <p><b>Monday</b> - Integrated Google sign-on logic and buttons to the home page of the website. The only remaining step, or problem, is to create an account with Google so that we can allow users to log-in using their service. This Google sign-on only allows users with "vhhscougars.org" domains, exactly how we intended.<br>
                <b>Tuesday</b> - Used claude.ai to revamp our website's design, focusing on a more modern design that still contains old-school references. There were a couple formatting/sizing issues, but the AI was highly effective.<br>
                <b>Wednesday</b> - Prepped the website by adding a similarly styled "Videos" page that was properly formatted for the video I created on Thursday. Had a couple issues with embedding the YouTube video, but the process was relatively smooth other than that.<br>
                <b>Thursday</b> - Began utilizing the 360 camera for video production purposes. Recorded my entire period of work as a timelapse using the camera. Ran into some small issues initially with connecting the camera's recording to my phone photo library.<br><br>
                The project is really coming together! The website design is definitely suitable for final production, so now it's time to begin preparing more user-centric elements, like finishing the Google sign-on feature and allowing video uploads. We're beginning to think that users uploading to YouTube first and then embedding from there might be ideal for hosting purposes (GitHub has strict limitations on hosting bandwith).

                </div>

                <h3><b>Week 3</b></h3>
                <p><b>Monday</b> - Created a dedicated Google account for the project. Logged into the portal for Google API services with that account. The only problem is that we need to get a payment method on there for it to start working.<br>
                <b>Tuesday</b> - Made the "Dashboard" page and added it to the taskbar on the home page. The dashboard derives information from the user's Google sign-on information. There were some small problems with replicating the style of the other pages.<br>
                <b>Wednesday</b> - Noticed a major problem: the dashboard page (on the taskbar) glitched when pressed from the home page. Began troubleshooting potential issues behind this.<br>
                <b>Thursday</b> - Figured out that the glitching problem was due to a Javascript conflict. Redid the code in the script.js file so that an error code is displayed when clicking dashboard without signing in (since no user information can be derived) and still brings the user there after they successfully sign in with Google. This was a relatively issue-free process after the original problem was identified.<br>
                <b>Friday</b> - Recorded a second in-class work video to upload to the website. Used some new features on the 360 camera, like the 0.5 lens. No problems with this.<br><br>
                Not a super busy week, but these things had to be done. Things should get more exciting next week after getting the Google situation finally hammered out. We're also looking into a few potential new features for the user and adding more information to the home page so that it looks extra professional. 
                </p>

                </div>

                <h3><b>Week 4</b></h3>
                <p><b>Monday</b> - Created two new dropdowns on the "Videos" page to expand the range of content available. Nothing too crazy. No real problems since it was mainly replication of previous code.<br>
                <b>Tuesday</b> - Added pictures and videos to the new dropdowns available on the website. Faced a consistent file-naming issue. Overcame it with the help of some online/AI tools.<br>
                <b>Wednesday</b> - Recorded the first ever "Walk the Halls" video using the 360 camera. Then, created another dropdown to store future content from this category. There were a few things to learn with the camera but no major problems.<br>
                <b>Thursday</b> - Renamed the "Videos" page to "Content." Tackled a major problem with the viewer on the "Content" page (unable to view pictures, only videos). This wasn't overly difficult because of resources I found on YouTube, but it was definitely something that needed to be fixed. It did take a while though.<br>
                Content heavy week. Lots of new videos and pictures available as well as a good amount of new categories that will good for future contributions. The Google Cloud Console/API situation should be figured out very soon. Not much of an update there. What we really want to focus on is the process of getting users to upload/send content of their own that we can publish to the website.

                <h3><b>Week 1</b></h3>
                <p><b>Monday</b> - Recorded new content for the website (daily development video, walk the halls). Also received a new dog image for that section. No real problems here.<br>
                <b>Tuesday</b> - Uploaded new content to the website. Began tinkering with a new media viewer. There were some small troubles with getting the new media to appear (mediaID mistakes).<br>
                <b>Wednesday</b> - Made a new media viewer. No longer is there a dedicated box at the bottom of the page. Now, media displays directly out of the different dropdowns. There were a couple little issues with getting the media to fit the new viewer, but this was overall a relatively straightforward process.<br>
                <b>Thursday</b> - Created the contact form part of the website. Entirely new feature. Ran into some minor issues with matching up the color scheme/style. Those will need to be fixed tomorrow.<br>
                <b>Friday</b> - Figured out the color issue thanks to the help of Claude. Fully implemented the "Contact" section on the main taskbar of the website. Not many problems today (since I solved the main one from yesterday).<br><br>
